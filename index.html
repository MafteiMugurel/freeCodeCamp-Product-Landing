                    With the meticulous craftsmanship and timeless design of a fine mechanical watch, ASUS ZenWatch 3 is
                    a timepiece you’ll want to wear every day. With a look inspired by an annular solar eclipse, it
                    exudes sophisticated style and delivers a new level of powerful functionality.

                <p>
                    ASUS ZenWatch 3 is meticulously fashioned from jewelry-grade 316L stainless steel, resulting in a
                    luxurious accessory that not only looks incredible, but feels great to wear as well. This premium,
                    cold-forged steel is 82% stronger than traditional steel to ensure that ASUS ZenWatch 3 stands up to
                    the rigors of daily wear. A diamond-cut bezel and intricately detailed setting add a further touch
                    of refinement and precision. With ASUS ZenWatch 3, total luxury never looked so good.

                <p>
                    A new thin-bezel and three-button design redefines the smartwatch to provide quicker and easier
                    operation. The customizable top button provides quick access to your favorite app or feature. The
                    middle button provides a range of functions, including access to Interactive, Ambient, Theater, and
                    Brightness Boost modes. The bottom button switches the watch to Eco Mode for the times you need
                    extra-long battery life.

                <p>
                    In order to achieve gorgeous looks and all-day comfort, we specially selected genuine Italian
                    leather for the watch strap. This design detail is just one of the ways ASUS ZenWatch 3 delivers
                    total luxury and aligns with our dedication to create a new classic.

                <p>
                    ASUS ZenWatch 3 is powered by the latest Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ Wear 2100 processor, which consumes
                    25% less energy than the previous Snapdragon™ 400 processor for dramatically improved battery life.
                    An all-new Eco Mode — instantly enabled with one click of the watch's bottom button — extends
                    battery life by more than 200% and turns off networking and notifications for times when you do not
                    want to be disturbed. ASUS ZenWatch 3 also features exclusive HyperCharge technology that provides
                    industry-leading charge times — just 15 minutes to reach a 60% charge — and a convenient magnetic
                    charging connector that snaps into place automatically. To keep ASUS ZenWatch 3 on your wrist even
                    longer, an optional battery pack is available that provides 40% more battery life without
                    sacrificing your watch’s stylish looks.
